	<h1>Browncoat</h1>
	<h2>for now the most rudimentary front end framework ever</h2>
	<section class="row-fluid">
		<div class="span3">
			<h3>Browncoat is</h3>
			<p>a lightweight front end framework built partially on php and less. Rather than having a huge css file Browncoat will use libraries than can be included or excluded by means of a configuration file (kaylee.php) somehow. Browncoat is in its infancy, or rather even before that, so fucking tear it apart do with it as you wish and suggest anything you want.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="span3">
			<h3>Some Goals</h3>
			<p>of Browncoat are to create a good starting point for front end developers working in any area. Whether that is developing for CMS's (like drupal, wordpress, expression engine, etc) or frameworks (such as ruby on rails, grails, codeigniter or laravel) Browncoat should provide a starting point for prototyping or even integrating into those systems (not sure how by the way but that's why we call 'em goals).</p>
		</div>
		<div class="span3">
			<h3>My Promises</h3>
			<p>none...I am building this because I need it...if someone makes something better that I can use I'll steal that and abandon this project...ok...no I won't but I still make no promises about updates or whatever. For as long as this is relevant all my free time will go towards making this framework as awesome as I can, but I am a human with a job and I like to drink and pass out a lot.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="span3">
			<h3>Documentation</h3>
			<p>The way I see documentation for stuff is usually this: "what the fuck are you talking about?" so hopefully I will have better documentation that is readable to human beings even those who have 0 experience with every single part of this. If I ever answer your question and you don't know what the hell I mean say so...I need to be able to convey real answers to people  of all experience levels. Granted, if you are an idiot I'll tell you that too</p>
