	<p>This section contains documentation for everything contained in the <code>assets/scss/browncoat/</code> directory. </p>
	
	
	<h3>Using scss files</h3>
	<p>For more information on the <strong>browncoat scss pattern</strong> see the <a href="/">front page</a> of the documentation. This section covers the contents inside the <code>browncoat</code> directory under <code>assets/scss</code> which contains two directories with files aggregated in <code>assets/scss/_browncoat.scss</code></p>
	<h4>bases directory</h4>
	<p>The bases directory <code>assets/scss/bases/</code> follows one important rule. <strong>Nothing</strong> from these scss files should output any actual css. This directory is reserved for variables and mixins.</p>
	<h4>normalizers directory</h4>
	<p>The normalizers directory <code>assets/scss/normalizers/</code> is the core of the browncoat css. It contains all the styles for all plain html elements as well as the foundations for the grid system and containers.</p>
