			<p>Cool, this means you got the <em>full source</em> meaning you could see this on your local install. All you actually need is the <em>assets/</em> directory (folder). This contains all the js, scss, compiled css (remember don't edit there if you are using scss for your project), Images, and r.js optimization files.</p>

			<h4>I only want to keep some of this css</h4>
			<p>Sweet, the core of <em>browncoat</em> is just the <em>scss/browncoat/</em> directory. That gives you the most plain usable version of <em>browncoat's</em> scss.</p>
			<p>In the <em>scss/app/</em> directory <em>devs/</em>, <em>clients/</em>, and <em>vendors/</em> are totally optional and you could delete them. The libs are also optional but there's some good stuff in there. <a href="#css">more</a></p>

			<h4>I only want to keep some of this js</h4>
			<p>'Aight, if there's nothing you like in the js then you can delete it all and make your own. If you like the <em>Require.js</em> concept then <a href="#requirejs">here</a>. If you don't but you want to keep the <em>jQuery Plugins</em> then <a href="#jqueryplugins">here</a>. If you don't like <em>coffeescript</em> then <a href="#coffee">here</a>. If all you want is the <em>few helpers</em> included with <em>browncoat</em> then <a href="#helpers">here</a>.</p>
