Welcome to browncoat
==================


## about this project

### credit where credit is due

I would never have considered creating any of this had I not come across [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) which is a much more complete framework as of January 30th 2012 and if you are looking for something like that you should check it out. It's pretty cool.

### goals

- a front end framework that allows for fast project prototyping.
- built using PHP, LESS, HTML5, and jQuery. 
- uses great existing libraries such as [isotope.js](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) and [history.js]( https://github.com/balupton/History.js/) and has options for ajax content loading, etc.
- documentation that normal people can understand. I will at times be that asshole that says incomprehensible things. It is up to whoever asks the question to tell me I am being that asshole and I will do my best to explain. That said, at some point I will give up on anyone.
- more to come


``` javascript
//just reminding myself how to add code blocks...
```


### Explain kaylee.php

``` PHP
	$useless //determines whether to use the less script to compile server side or use an already compiled css file
	$genericTitle //if individual pages don't have a $title var set use this title other wise browncoat decides the title
	$isResponsive //add the meta tag for it to work on mobile devices...and possibly do other stuff that I haven't decided yet
```

> Note: you can totally do away with kaylee.php and fall back on defaults or manually enter your own. Perhaps I should have a separate version that doesn't use php at all? keeping it truly front end?




### this is the worst readme file right now
